# [NUCC++ Parser](https://github.com/KojoBailey/nucc-cpp-parser/)
Welcome to the **[NUCC C++ Parser](https://github.com/KojoBailey/nucc-cpp-parser/)**, a drag-and-drop terminal-based tool for **unpacking** CyberConnect2 XFBIN files to more **easily-editable** formats (such as JSON) and vice versa.

It makes use of the **[NUCC C++ Library](https://github.com/KojoBailey/nucc-cpp-library/)**, and in a way, is the most basic demonstration of the library in action. Later, I plan to overshadow this tool with a GUI NUCC toolbox, but this parser here should always prove useful regardless.

## How To Use
